#Prevalence of Diabetes: Out of 2,954 pregnancies, 44% were diagnosed as diabetic. This incicates a reatively high prevalence of diabetes in this population


#Age and Diabetes: The majority of diabetic women fall within the age range of 20-60. This suggests that diabetes is prevalent across different age groups, with a higher concentration in middle-aged individuals it's important to target diabetes prevention and management efforts across all age groups, with a focus on those in their 30s and 40s


#Insulin Levels: Insuan readings provide insights into the type and severity of diabetes: The presence of individuals with very low insulin levels (mu U/ml) suggests the poss baty of type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune condition. High insulin levels (> 105 mu /m may indicate insulin resistance, a common feature in type 2 diabetes. Moderate insulin levels [100 mu U/ml) may also be seen in type 2 diabetes. Effective diabetes management should be tailored to the specific type and insulin levels of patients. 
                                                                          

#Blood Glucose Levels: Most diabetic patients exhibit plasma glucose concentrations between 126 and 200 mg/dL during 2-hour cral glucose tolerance test. This range indicates Impaired glucose tolerance and is characteristic of diabetes Glycemic contro is essential for diabetes management and patients falling within this range should receive education and support on blood sugar management through diet, exercice and medication as needed


#BMI and Weight: Some diabetic patients are classified as obese or overweight. Weight management is crucial for diabetes control, and individuals with high BMI should be encouraged to adopt a healthier lifestyle, including e balanced diet and regular physical activity. 

#Blood Pressure: Blood pressure levels can impact diabetes management Monitoring and maintaining healthy blood pressure (between 50-80 m Hy is essential for diabetic patients to reduce the risk of complications. Those with elevated blood pressure should receive appropriate treatment and lifestyle advice.


#Skin Thickness: White skin thickness may not directly correlate with diabetes, it could be indicative of other health issues. Further investigation may be needed to understand any potential associations


#Pedigree Function: The Pedigree Function values indicate the genetic risk of diabetes: Patients in the high-risk category may benefit from more intensive monitoring and ifestyle interventions to reduce their risk.
